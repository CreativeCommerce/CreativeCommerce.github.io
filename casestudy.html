        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white">
          Key Challenge:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
          A Manager in an organisation figured out that team members are consistently confused as to what High Performance
          Deliverables were. The root cause was Team Members were unable to relate to what to do and why they need to do it!
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white mt-4">
          Solution:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
          Skillfully applying “Asking Questions” and “Active Listening”, the Manager uncovered individual issues and team issues.
          Using the skill of “Contracting for Success” and “Setting High Performance Goals”, the Manager then ensured commitment
          to “minimum acceptable performance levels”. Along with this, the Manager also provide feedback using techniques learnt
          from “Giving and Receiving Feedback”
          This lead to higher levels of involvement from all team members resulting in a higher level of performance!

        <p class="text-md lg:text-2xl text-white mt-12">Case Study 2: Giving and Receiving Feedback</p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white">
          Key Challenge:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
          One of the Manager’s team member was not performing well. The Manager hesitated to provide “hard” and “realistic”
          feedback fearing backlash and negative impact. The Manager was also not comfortable “confronting” this team member.

        
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white mt-4">
          Solution:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
        After going through our case studies and role-play practice in the program, the manager realised that the key is to be
        prepared. The manager gathered data points, feedback from stakeholders and the team member’s peers, and also considered
        various behaviors that the team member displayed on the job. Armed with the confidence of being prepared, the manager
        “confronted” the team member. Initially, there were “hiccups” in the conversation, and the conversation itself had to be
        completed over a couple of days. But the manager finally managed to get through to the team member.
        Once the feedback, backed with data was provided and action points agreed upon, the team member went on to display
        expected behavior and performance over the agreed upon 3 months. This lead to the team members’ success and, also, had a
        positive impact on the team.

        <p class="text-md lg:text-2xl text-white mt-12">Case Study 3: Effective 1 – to – 1 Meetings</p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white">
          Key Challenge:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
        This particular manager was struggling with 1 – to – 1 conversations. With little “know how” of how a 1 – to – 1 is
        conducted the manager did what comes naturally from experience with their Boss. After the 1 – to – 1 meetings, the team
        members as well as the manager continued to feel that it was not the best use of their time.

        
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white mt-4">
          Solution:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
        While going through the program, and as part of a practicum, the manager developed their own “template” for an effective
        1 – to – 1 meeting. Using this “template” the 1 – to – 1 meeting started yielding excellent result, some in areas such
        as engagement, career discussion, regular performance feedback, relationship with team members, stakeholder management
        and the like. It also helped the Manager to collect feedback on their own style.
        Over all, it lead to an increase in productivity, innovation and building a virtuous team culture.

        <p class="text-md lg:text-2xl text-white mt-12">Case Study 4: Delegate for Results:</p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white">
          Key Challenge:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
          This manager complained that there are simply too many things to do, which prevented them from performing “managerial”
          duties such as monitoring performance, addressing productivity, analyzing and suggesting changes in process and the
          like.

        
        
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-xl font-light text-white mt-4">
          Solution:
        </p>
        <p class="text-md lg:text-lg font-light text-white">
          While going through the Effective Manager Journey, one of the key skills this manager picked up was how to Delegate. The
          pre-read helped the manager understand the basic framework. Discussing within the Learning Circle helped clarify
          concepts, interaction with the facilitator surfaced own “limitations”, “biases”, “fears” etc. which stopped this manager
          from practicing delegation. Practicums helped this manager take the first steps. Further discussions within the Learning
          Circle provided important feedback that sharpened self-awareness. Finally, Group Training with the Facilitator firmed up
          this manager’s “action points on delegation”. “How to practice delegation” emerged due to a combination of all these
          Learning Elements.
          In a span of 3 months after the program, the manager took on more and more responsibility, and due to their excellent
          delegation skills, the talent in the team is looking forward to take on more and more tasks!
